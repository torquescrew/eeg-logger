TODO:


 - remember location thread

 - modularise css
 - delete log
 - refactor stores
 - show value of mouse pos on data panel
 - comparison of logs over time
 - need a read out of signal before starting to record
 - volume control
 - output sound without recording?
 - timed session and timer
 - white noise/rain sounds in background option?
 - fake signal generator for testing


Settings:
 - smoothing? - average based on the number of visible points
 -

Possible:
 - export/import of logs?
 - keep deleted logs/allow restore?


if virtual canvas contains any visible trace, blot to screen
draw rest of screen
save screen to virtual canvas

how to keep track of what is still visible on virtual canvas? - will this work with sampling?
