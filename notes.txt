TODO:
 - when viewing log, data panel should fit full log on screen, ie zoom 100%
 - save location to server
 - display stat averages in history mode
 - improve appearance of data panel
    - show time/y values
 - show url location
 - remember location thread
 - fix event handler leaks
 - get working with actual headset
    - connect headset
 - electron
 - modularise css
 - need a channel per frequency since they each have their own scale.
 - delete log
 - label axis

Settings:
 - which traces to display
 - smoothing? - average based on the number of visible points
 -

export/import of logs?

Location keeping:

plain array:
['history', '12453453.json']

map:
{'history': [], 'start': [], 'settings': [], current: 'start'}

location object:
location['history']['2432365.json']



if virtual canvas contains any visible trace, blot to screen
draw rest of screen
save screen to virtual canvas

how to keep track of what is still visible on virtual canvas? - will this work with sampling?
